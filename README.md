# Move-To-Front (MTF)-Transform

MTF transform is typically used to improve entropy encoding for compression. Keep in mind that it is not a compression algorithm itself; rather a pre-processor step for compression itself. Depending on the characteristics of the data, benefits achieved by this step greatly justify this additional step.

This algorithm was first published by Boris Ryabko under the name of "book stack" in 1980.
